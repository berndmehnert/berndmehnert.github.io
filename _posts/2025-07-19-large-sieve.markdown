We let $$\alpha_{1},...,\alpha_{R}$$ be $$R$$ real numbers that are pairwise distinct modulo one and we let
$$a=(a_{n})_{M<n\leq M+N}$$ be an arbitrary $$N$$-vector of complex numbers. We let further

$$S(\alpha)=\sum_{M<n\leq M+N}a_{n}e(\alpha n),$$

where as usual $$e(x):=\exp (2\pi ix)$$. 

Then

$$\sum_{r\leq R}|S(\alpha)|^{2}\leq(N-1+\delta^{-1})\left\Vert a\right\Vert ^{2},$$

where $$\delta$$ is the minimum distance between different $$\alpha_{i}$$ in
$$\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$$. The above is an example of a "Large Sieve"-inequality ...
