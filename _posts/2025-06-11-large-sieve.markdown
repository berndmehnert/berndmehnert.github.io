We let $$\alpha_{1},...,\alpha_{R}$$ be $$R$$ modulo one distinct real numbers and 
$$a=(a_{n})_{M<n\leq M+N}$$ a $$N$$-vector of complex numbers. We let further

$$S(\alpha)=\sum_{M<n\leq M+N}a_{n}(\alpha n).$$ 

Then

$$\sum_{r\leq R}|S(\alpha)|^{2}\leq(N-1+\delta^{-1})\left\Vert a\right\Vert ^{2},$$

where $$\delta$$ is the minimum distance between different $$\alpha_{i}$$ in
$$\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$$. The above is an example of a "Large Sieve"-inequality ...
